# Simple Document Versioning with CouchDB iOS

I wanted to store document edit history in my emebeded couchbase couchdb on iOS. Couchdb creates revsion of documents that are used during replication for conflict resolution but because compaction removes these revisons they can not be used as a persistent store of document edit history. J. Chris Anderson describes different approches to document versioning in [Simple Document Versioning with CouchDB](http://blog.couchbase.com/simple-document-versioning-couchdb). MLCouchModel implements the attachment versioning system for iOS on top of CocoaCouch CouchModel.
